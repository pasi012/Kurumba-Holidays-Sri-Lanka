                                        En route visit the Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage. Inaugurated in 1975, this orphanage began by providing caring for seven orphan elephants. Though its objectives were also linked with tourism, it soon focused on conservation and to become an educational centre.

                                        The free movement of the herd enhanced the chances for both sexes of elephants to mate; the nearby river played a dominant role in this regard, and in 1984, the first baby of Pinnawala was born. It is significant that some of the orphan elephants have even seen their “grandchildren” being born here! The success story of Pinnawala has drawn the attention of scientists from all over the world. A considerable number of books and research articles on the orphanage have been published in several languages. The members of the Pinnawala herd have also been filmed, videoed and photographed thousands of times by professionals.

The 'Lion Rock' is a citadel of unusual beauty rising 200 metres from the scrub jungle. The rock was the innermost stronghold of the 70-hectare fortified town. A moat, rampart and extensive gardens including the renowned water gardens ring the base of the rock. Visit the famed frescoes of the 'Heavenly Maidens' of Sigiriya, which are in a sheltered pocket of the rock, approached by a spiral stairway. These frescoes are painted in earth pigments on plaster and are a truly wondrous sight.

                                    <p>
                                        These gardens were first created during the reign of a Sinhala king and served the purpose of being a pleasure garden for royalty. The British, who subsequently took over the Kandyan Kingdom, expanded and made improvements to this picturesque site. Encompassing 147 acres, the Royal Botanical Gardens features an amazing variety of trees, plants and flowers and is a great place to explore amidst nature’s beauty.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        On completion of your visit to the gardens, set off on a city tour; Kandy was the last capital of the Sri Lankan kings and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site with much to discover. The name “Kandy” conjures visions of splendour and magnificence and many of its legends, traditions and folklore are still lovingly kept alive.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Drive around the Kandy Lake built by the last Sinhala king, Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe in 1798. Visit the bustling Kandy town and bazaar, as well as the arts and crafts centre, a gem museum and a lapidary. Additionally, head to the Temple of the Tooth, which houses a Sacred Tooth Relic of Lord Buddha and is the focal point of an annual festival known as the Kandy Esala Perahera.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Thereafter witness a cultural show which offers more insight into the city’s rich culture and traditions.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        End the day relaxing at your hotel.

Here you could observe all about the process of manufacturing tea and also see how it is graded. As part of the tour, taste a cup of pure Ceylon tea in the factory.

Nuwara Eliya is also the heart of Sri Lanka’s tea country producing a significant share of the world’s best tea. While the nation’s highest mountain Piduruthalagala (8,282 feet) is located here, this idyllic mountainside hideaway is home to one of the finest 18-hole golf courses in South Asia as well.

                                        The Kelani River (the broadest river in Sri Lanka) which flows through Kitulgala was the main location where the Oscar-winning movie "The Bridge on the River Kwai" was filmed. On the hill above this town, a prehistoric cave was recently discovered containing large middens of shells from some unknown civilisation. Kitulgala today, is also famed as being the country’s premier white water rafting destination.

                                        Following your stop here, make your way to the island’s commercial capital and check-in at a hotel in Colombo.

                                        In the afternoon embark on a city tour of Colombo, which like many commercial capitals in developing countries is rapidly evolving. Almost overnight, skyscrapers arise from where old buildings once stood. Yet in some parts, the old-world charm is retained. For example, there is a 100-year-old clock tower and several British built colonial buildings in this metropolis by the sea.

                                        Other places of interest are the Pettah Bazaar - where one can shop and bargain for a wide range of items, Hindu and Buddhist temples and residential areas where you can find stately homes. Other attractions include the National Museum of Colombo, the Dutch Museum and the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH); an outright gift to Sri Lanka from the People's Republic of China, it is one of the most popular venues in the city for exhibitions and conferences.
