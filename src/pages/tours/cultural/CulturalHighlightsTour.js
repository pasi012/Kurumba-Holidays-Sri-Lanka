Traverse across the town’s streets where you will find shops selling intricate souvenirs and international brands, a gem museum, and lapidary as well as an arts & crafts centre. Drive towards the Victoria Golf Course, one of the finest gold links in all of South Asia and appreciate some panoramic views and the game of golf. Immerse yourself in the bustling atmosphere of the Kandy Market after which you will be able to enjoy a cultural show which showcases the traditional drumming and dancing which form a major part of the Kandian identity.

                                        On completion of your Kandy adventures transfer to a beach hotel. En route visit the Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage; amidst this large 25 acre property, you have a chance to witness baby elephants being bottle fed as well as get up close to them. It is an amazing sight to observe how these orphaned and sometimes injured gentle giants are taken care of at this orphanage that was established in 1975. Over 20 calves have been born here, and it is interesting to note that some of the elephants here have even seen their “grandchildren” being raised here over the decades! Milk feeding time is at 09:15 am and 01:15 pm, while bath time for the elephants at the nearby river takes place at 10:00 am and 02:00 pm daily; both these activities offer a truly unforgettable experience.
