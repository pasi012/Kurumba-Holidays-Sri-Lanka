Last ruled by King Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe, before it was brought under the British rule in 1815, this city was the final royal capital of Sri Lankan kings. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it has a rich culture, history and heritage and attracts travellers from around the world.

Drive towards the Victoria Golf Course, undoubtedly one of the best golf courses in the world, with a unique class and style of its own. Alternatively, take a stroll amidst the vibrant colour of the fresh fruits and vegetables in the Kandy Market. Fine tune your evening by stepping to the beat of traditional music and drumming amplified by a cultural show that enhances the rich and vibrant culture of the Wonder of Asia, Sri Lanka.

                                        Thereafter visit the Royal Botanical Gardens in Peradeniya, a flourishing national asset. First developed as a pleasure garden under royalty and later improved upon by the British, the gardens are located just four miles from Kandy and feature the most welcoming facilities as well. Walk into this 147-acre haven for an experience of bliss, passing well-tended lawns, pavilions and an octagon conservatory. Be greeted by the vast expanse of magnificently landscaped, lush green turf which will encourage you to take an exhilarating break. Towards the north of the entrance is a cafeteria that one might come across, before heading to some of the highlights here; this includes the Orchid House and the giant Javan fig tree, each with their own sense of grace and beauty.

It is a sincerely moving sight to observe how these orphaned gentle giants, some of which have only three legs due to injury, are taken care of here.

                                        Misty steep roads, twisting through lush green blankets of tea bushes in a cool climate, remind visitors that they are within the range of the renowned British colonial retreat, Nuwara Eliya. Augmented by an English countryside atmosphere, the “City of Light” - once governed by English and Scottish planters - is still studded with colonial bungalows, hedgerows and one of the finest 18-hole golf courses in the world. A hike through the green grass and past redbrick walls should present breathtaking views of a buzzing countryside hamlet.

Or rent a bike for a gentle ride along the banks splashed by the waters of Lake Gregory.

                                        Showered by two monsoons each year, Kitulgala - the destination of the acclaimed movie 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' - marks an important period in many calendars as one of the wettest places in Sri Lanka. If adventure close to Colombo is your pick, then Kitulgala is your bliss!
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Grab your gear and toss into the wild rapids for a seamless rafting challenge on white water, thundering downstream, gushing and splashing far and wide. Hop from rock to rock upstream for a mind-blowing waterfall jump that should strain your voice to the core or slide down to the darkest depths of caves haunted by millions of bats. If hardcore adventurism is not for you, then simply trek along the beaten track to admire the immaculate beauty of the wilderness.
