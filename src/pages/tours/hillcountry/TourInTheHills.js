                                        An unforgettable experience awaits at this popular attraction where orphaned and sometimes injured gentle giants of the wild are cared for. Established in 1975, the Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage encompasses a 25-acre property and offers visitors a chance to get up close to elephants, some of which have been born here as well. Highlights include seeing elephants being bottle fed (09:15am and 01:15pm) and watching as they play and cool off during bath time (10:00am and 02:00pm) at the river nearby.

Originally a royal pleasure garden, this site was later developed by the British; today, it offers the ideal escape from the bustling city and features lush lawns, charming pavilions and a vibrant variety of flowering plants. The Orchid House is a not to be missed attraction here as is the giant Javan fig tree.

                                        Hike to the banks of Baker’s Falls and appreciate the majestic views the gushing streams of water create. Gaze down World's End, a head-spinning 3,700 feet drop towards the southern end or drive past herds of sambar deer. If you're lucky enough you may be greeted by the sights of a grunting wild boar, a pouncing fishing cat, otters or even the 'spotted-ghost that haunts the plains' - the Sri Lankan Leopard!
